## Licence:  
You do not have to include [the full licence](https://github.com/Hyakki999/YAGPDB-cc/blob/main/LICENSE) in the code because it is too long. That's why I made [this small text](#small-licence-text) that has to stay in the code if it is found there.  
If [that licence](#small-licence-text) can not be found on the code in this repository, you can do whatever you want with the code.  

#### Small licence text:
```
