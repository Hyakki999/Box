## Duck hunt
As the name implies, this is a game where we hunt ducks.

The currency is ducks. So hunting ducks is the goal. Random amount of ducks will be spawning in your server's general chat and only one person can pick those up.  There's also daily, spin the wheel, slot machine etc. to get more ducks. 

To see the list of commands type: _-quack_

## Adding these custom commands

You are required to add all the Commands. When you find a custom command you wish to add, the file will have a leading comment explaining what it does and the recommended trigger type & trigger value will be given in comments. You need to add it in the YAGPDB dashboard with these attributes.

If you aren't too familiar with custom command or just need a refresher, [this article](https://github.com/Hyakki999/YAGPDB-cc/blob/main/README.md) explains it well.
