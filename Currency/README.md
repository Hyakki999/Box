# Duck hunt
  This is one of the best currency game I have played in discord.
  And this game is more enjoyable when you have an active server.

## Gameplay is simple.
  There will be duck spawning in your server's general channel randomly and only one person can pick it up.
  This will be a hell for slow writers :( 
  There's also daily, leaderboard, mini-games etc.
  To see the list of commands type: -commands

  Read comments while setting this up.
  Comments are written like this 
=> {{/* comments */}}
  It will guide you on how to set it up.
