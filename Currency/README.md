# Duck Hunt
Gameplay is simple and works best in a active server.
There will be duck spawning in the spawner channel when you set up the spawner custom command and only one user can pick at a time.
The main commands are: 
1. Duck Spawner.
2. Basic commands.

Though rest of the commands are important as well.
To see the list of commands type `-welp`.
